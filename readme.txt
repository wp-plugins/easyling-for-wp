Easyling is a WordPress translation plugin, suitable for DIY work, crowdsource translation or order the professional translation service.

== Description ==

[Easyling.com](http://www.easyling.com/?utm_source=easyling-wp-plugin-admin&utm_medium=admin-link&utm_campaign=easyling-wp "") is a proxy-based website translation solution. It crawls your website, finds all the pages and texts. Then you can do the translation yourself using our in-context, live editing/preview/review editor, or export as an XLIFF file and do the translation in your favourite CAT tool.

Once the translation of your Wordpress is done, this Easyling for Wordpress plugin does the magic: automatically downloads your translations from Easyling only once, 
and presents it to your visitors using domain-based or URL-based configuration, i.e.:

*   www.example.com for the main language
*   www.example.com/de/ for the German translation

Or

*   www.example.com for the main language
*   www.example.de for the German translation

Or

*   www.example.com for the main language
*   http://de.example.com for the German translation

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Link your Wordpress Installation with your Easyling Account

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the Easyling for Wordpress Plugin free to use? =

Yes, 100% free. [Easyling.com Website Translation](http://www.easyling.com/pricing/?utm_source=easyling-wp-plugin-admin&utm_medium=admin-link&utm_campaign=easyling-wp "") also has got a free plan.

= Will it work with my theme? =

Yes. By design, it doesn't matter what theme do you use. 

= Do I need to set up an account with Easyling? =

Yes! The Plugin is not worth much without an Easyling account. You can create one by visiting [Easyling](https://app.easyling.com/login/frame/reg "")

= What is that "linking" and how do I do that? =

It is necessary to "link" your WP Installation with Easyling so the plugin can download the translations from the Easyling application in the cloud.

= How do I import the translations? =

Once you have an Easyling account and you get some translations done, navigate to the Easyling menu on your WordPress admin and simply click
Retrieve Translations. The process may take up to a few minutes, but it's safe to close the browser, it happens in the background.

= Is it stable for production use? =

To date it has been tested with a standard WordPress 4.1 installation running Apache and MySQL on Ubuntu server, however there could be
certain edge cases when the plugin is not 100% functional! If you happen to stumble upon such issue, just give us feedback and weâ€™ll be happy to fix it.
